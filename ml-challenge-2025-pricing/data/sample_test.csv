Product Description: Slate is a strength brand that makes high protein drinks that are better for you and better for our planet. Our protein drinks contain 20g protein, 1g sugar, 110 calories or less, are lactose free, keto friendly, and unbelievably delicious. Slate chocolate milks come in Classic Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, Mocha Latte, Vanilla Latte, Caramel Latte, and French Vanilla flavors. Our High Protein Iced Coffees are caffeinated with 175mg of caffeine and are commonly used as a coffee replacement. We’re able to control exactly which ingredients go into our products using a process called ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltered milk has had all of the lactose sugars filtered out. It also removes some water and allows us to create a more protein packed, lower sugar product. We also sell our all natural products in recyclable aluminum cans, that can be easily taken on the go as ready to drink protein shakes. You can drink a Slate anytime, but our customers like to use it as a breakfast meal replacement, protein coffee, post workout protein shake, healthy snack, or a healthy dessert. We use absolutely no artificial ingredients, and are gluten free, soy free, nut free, and Kosher Certified. Our high protein drinks are also shelf stable and can be stored at room temperature in your cabinet for months. But as most tasty refreshing beverages we recommend drinking them cold! Giving Chocolate Milk a Clean Slate - Manny Lubin and Josh Belinsky co-founded Slate with the goal of creating a healthy chocolate milk they could drink every day. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, an appearance on ABC's Shark Tank, and hundreds of iterations of testing, Slate launched in late 2019 with three delicious chocolate milk flavors. Today, Slate has expanded into new flavors and additional product lines, all of which contain 20g protein, have 1g sugar, are lactose free, and 100% plastic neutral.

Bullet Point 3: Gut You Feelin’ Good: Each probiotic soda contains billions of CFUs of live probiotics at the time of canning. Each 12 oz can is 45-50 calories, 8-11g total sugar, plant-based, kosher, non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free. Contains no stevia or artificial sweeteners for a delicious, real flavor.

Our probiotic remains viable under a wide temperature and pH range, via stability testing, the probiotics that we use experienced virtually no loss of colony-forming units (CFU) over 24 months when stored at room temperature (25°C). This allows you to keep some of the drinks in your fridge and the rest in your pantry!

Culture Pop is a probiotic soda made with organic fruit juices and real, ground organic spices & herbs. Each 12 oz can contains 45 calories and billions of CFU’s of live probiotics at the time of canning. Compared to other prebiotic soda, lemon lime soda, organic soda, strawberry soda, strawberry rhubarb, Culture Pop is made the way that you’d hope your soda would be made! Each flavor is crafted by steeping organic spices and/or herbs into an organic blend of real fruit juices! We then add billions of CFU’s of our live probiotic to each can. The result is a delicious, complex, slightly sweet soda - with only 45 calories per can. Each flavor is familiar - flavors you already know & love - but with a tasty twist. And, of course, we use no refined sweeteners, no stevia, and no other high-intensity or artificial sweeteners. Our low-sugar sodas are non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, and plant-based. Culture Pop is not fermented, our probiotic does not impact the flavor of our sodas, and there is no vinegar-like aftertaste that sometimes is found with kombucha products. Unlike kombucha, Culture Pop is shelf-stable and can be stored at ambient temperatures.

Bullet Point 2: EXTREMELY SATISFYING: Our 70-gram bar, a robust blend of macronutrients, serves as a potent, delicious, and filling meal replacement. Almost all low-calorie protein bars are less than satisfying and taste like synthetic ""diet"" food, and almost all higher-calorie protein bars taste like chemical-laden sugar bombs.

The fast digestion of whey isolate aids in rapid muscle repair and growth. Its easy digestion enhances bioavailability, optimizing protein absorption while maintaining GI (gastrointestinal) well-being. Indulge in this stomach-friendly treat for a rapid and efficient post-workout protein uplift.
Product Description: 20 Grams Of High-Quality Protein Incredible Taste And Texture GI Friendly And Won't Bog You Down Extremely Satisfying (actually curbs appetite and cravings) Emphasis On Whey Protein Isolate The Gorilla Bar has arrived! Formerly, the Peanut Butter Bar, which launched in the Summer of 2023, had the goal of providing an incredibly tasty, satisfying bar with high-quality protein that won’t bog you down or upset your stomach. We accomplished those goals and were very happy with the bar, but we recognized there was still room for improvement. All of the significant changes that impact all Gorilla Bar flavors include: Improved Flavors: our first generation bars all used peanut butter as the base nut butter, which is a powerful flavor that masked much of the individual flavor in each bar. In addition to increasing the flavor intensity, we also switched to a cashew butter base for cookies & cream, oatmeal chocolate chip, and cookie dough. We did keep peanut butter for the peanut butter cup flavor of course. Lastly, we optimized the sodium content for maximum flavor. Improved Texture: our first generation bars were firmer than we wanted them to be and become firmer over the course of their shelf life. To improve this, we adjusted the ratio of whey powder to whey crisps, introduced more inclusions such as chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, or cookie pieces, and adjusted the overall protein content slightly to 20 grams per bar. The outcome was a much softer bar with better texture. Improved Melt Point: to help address the potential for the bars melting in hot climates during the summer months we’ve improved the coating used on the bars. This provides a higher melt point. While this doesn’t guarantee they won’t begin to melt in very hot conditions, it does increase the melt point relative to our first generation bars for a better customer experience.

That’s how Thurman Robert, Sir & Hisako T. Roberts gave the Salt Lick Bar-B-Que its famous name. They did everything by hand. They credited the quality of their food to cooking with love and care, and they were only satisfied when the job was done right. We’re proud to continue that tradition.

Bullet Point 2: An alternative to diet sodas - no diet sweetener aftertaste, and half the sugar content of traditional sodas. Enjoy less calories without sacrificing taste!
Bullet Point 3: A crisp and refreshing take on Cola, without the overpowering sticky sweetness found in other Colas.
Product Description: Demi Doux low sugar sodas are made with about half the sugar you’ll find in “regular” sodas. That means the underlying flavors aren’t masked by sweetness; you’ll taste a deep richness of flavor that isn’t possible with highly sweetened sodas. A typical 12-oz can of soda contains over 3 tablespoons of sugar. On average, Americans consume about 77 pounds of sugar each year, more than half of which comes from soft drinks! Demi Doux cuts the sugar in half, making it lower calorie and less filling while still delivering great taste. Because it is less filling, low sugar Demi Doux is great with meals and contributes to a healthier diet. Demi Doux uses only real cane sugar – no corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. That means it’s more thirst quenching than regular or diet sodas, and tastes better than artificially sweetened soft drinks or drinks made with corn syrup.

Product Description: Very fruity character inspiring memories of juicy, ripe pears. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot tea since it will be poured over ice and diluted with cold water]. Please note that this tea may tend to go cloudy or &quot;milky&quot; when poured over ice; a perfectly normal characteristic of some high quality black teas and nothing to worry about! - What type of tea do we use, how do we flavor the tea and why do we use natural flavors? - Firstly...we only use high grown teas from the top 3 tea growing regions of Sri Lanka - Nuwara Eliya, Dimbula and Uva. These three high-grown districts produce flavorful teas that have classic &quot;Ceylon&quot; tea character which is noted by floral bouquet and flavor notes, touches of mild astringency, bright coppery col

Could the same be said for Apricot tea? We'll never tell. - What we can tell you is that the apricot was first cultivated in China after fruit bearing trees were discovered growing on the temperate mountain slopes of that country. It's Latin name however, Prunus Armeniaca, owes its root to the fact that the fruit made its way westward via farmers in Armenia. - Eagerly awaited as one of the first fresh fruits of summer, Apricots are noted for their intense fragrance and sweet flavor. Fresh apricots are also a great source of vitamin A. The sweet character of the fruit blends exceptionally with our high grown Ceylon tea and goes well with a dash of sugar. So brew a pot, pour two cups and let the fireworks begin! - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves.

192061,"Item Name: Ray’s Country Ham (2.25 lb) – 3 × 12 oz | Authentic Blue Ridge Mountain Dry-Cured | Center & End Cuts | Robust Southern Flavor for Biscuits & More
Bullet Point 1: DESCRIPTION: Each order contains three (3) 12-oz packages of Country Ham, including two center cuts and end pieces per package. The ham is vacuum-packed, shelf-stable with or without refrigeration, and expertly trimmed of excess fat. Thinly sliced for quick preparation, it sears perfectly in a hot, heavy skillet in about one minute per side until it reaches an internal temperature of 155°F. This 3-pack is convenient for both use and storage.
Bullet Point 2: A TASTE FROM ANOTHER PLACE IN TIME: Rays Country Ham is more than just ham—it’s heritage. Crafted with century-old curing methods, our salt-cured, air-dried ham reflects traditions from North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Every slice delivers the deep, savory richness of authentic country ham. For over 75 years, Rays has been a Southern favorite, offering an unmistakable flavor that stands the test of time. Taste true Blue Ridge craftsmanship in every bite.
Bullet Point 3: RICH, BOLD FLAVOR – TRADITIONALLY CURED While many products labeled “country ham” may be unexpectedly mild, Ray’s preserves the deep, savory flavor that made Ray Goad’s legendary Country Ham Biscuits famous. Hand-rubbed with a classic blend of salt, pepper, and brown sugar, this Blue Ridge Mountain dry-cured and aged ham delivers the salty, robust taste that Country Ham lovers expect. If you’re seeking a genuinely authentic Country Ham experience, this is the flavor you’ve been craving.
Bullet Point 4: WHO WILL LOVE THIS HAM: Devoted Country Ham lovers who miss that true, salt, and dry-cured taste will feel at home with Rays Country Ham. This ham is for you if you grew up in the Southeast, where Country Ham & Biscuits are a staple at the breakfast table, family picnics, and funerals. It’s also a heartfelt gift of remembered flavors of traditional ham curing. Sharing good food is more than nourishment; it’s how we connect, reflect, and celebrate the ties that bring us together.
Bullet Point 5: FIRST-TIME BUYERS: WHAT TO EXPECT: If you’ve never tried authentic Country Ham, prepare for a bold, salty taste combined with a deep, savory flavor that differs from typical sweet ""city"" hams. If you prefer a milder flavor, soak the slices in a dish of cold water for 10 minutes to reduce the saltiness. However, this ham is for those who appreciate a traditional Southern salt and dry-cured ham, with the robust, savory character that has made Country Ham a beloved favorite for generations.
Bullet Point 6: COOKING & STORAGE (OWNER’S MANUAL INCLUDED): You’ll receive an Owner’s Manual with cooking instructions—helpful soaking tips, quick skillet-frying methods, and optional red-eye gravy recipes. Once opened, wrap and refrigerate or freeze for future meals. This flexible format ensures you can enjoy hearty portions of real Blue Ridge Mountain–cured ham when the craving strikes.
Bullet Point 7: A TIMELESS SOUTHERN TRADITION DELIVERED Ray Goad was the first to serve Country Ham Biscuits for breakfast in a Fast-Food restaurant, continuing a 75-year family tradition of dry-cured, aged country ham from North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Now, you can enjoy this bold, old-fashioned flavor at home—a cherished tradition, perfected and conveniently available for those who crave and truly appreciate authentic Country Ham. .

Product Description: Red Currants, (Latin: Ribes rubrum), are one of nature's hardiest berries. - The perennial plant is by nature deciduous and will grow just about anywhere. In fact, no special fertilization is required to help support the plants to produce their fruit. It is as though the plant simply wills itself to live! - Perhaps this is why historically in Ireland on All Hallow's Eve, (which we now know as Halloween), in an effort to ward off the grim claws of death, people went door to door in costume asking for buns made with red currants. Nowadays the berry is a favorite for making jams, jellies, and wine due to its tart flavor profile. The astringency of the berry also makes it a natural when paired with our high grown Ceylon tea. - We only use high grown Ceylon tea from estates more than 5500 feet above sea level; We only use natural flavors, giving a clean true taste with no chemical aftertaste - Hot tea brewing method: Bring freshly drawn cold water to a rolling boil. Place 1 teaspoon of tea for each cup into the teapot. Pour the boiling water into the teapot. Cover and let steep for 3-7 minutes according to taste (the longer the steeping time the stronger the tea). Even though milk and a dash of sugar help enhance the flavor character on this tea, it is perfectly acceptable to consume this tea &quot;straight-up.&quot; - Iced tea brewing method (to make 1 liter/quart): Place 6 teaspoons of tea into a teapot or heat resistant pitcher. Pour 1 1/4 cups of freshly boiled water over the tea. Steep for 5 minutes. Quarter fill a serving pitcher with cold water. Pour the tea into your serving pitcher straining the leaves. Add ice and top-up the pitcher with cold water. Garnish and sweeten to taste. [A rule of thumb when preparing fresh brewed iced tea is to double the strength of hot

Bullet Point 5: Revolutionary instant tea extract drink technology: healthy, portable, convenient, and delicious.
Product Description: Tea extract is the newest generation of instant tea beverages. Unlike other tea drinks and tea extracts, LeCharm’s distinct tea extract is both beneficial for a healthy lifestyle and enjoyable to drink. It’s sugar free, contains 0 calories, and contains 0 fats. Every drink of LeCharm’s tea extract beverage is pure flavor and nutrients. Tea extract drinks make instant tea because they’re made purely from natural substances extracted directly from fresh tea leaves. After all those substances are extracted, they’re blended and refined till the LeCharm tea extract is ready to go. There are 0 calories, 0 fats, and no added sugar because those substances aren’t extracted or involved. The tea extract is in the form of a powder that smoothly melts into liquid water at hot or cold temperatures. This tea drink is the height of portability. After getting their crystallized tea powder sachet out, they can create iced tea with some cold water or get the feeling of a freshly brewed pot using hot water. Traditional tea drinks, like loose leaf tea, take equipment and time to create. That sort of preparation is inconvenient for one’s daily life. Tea can’t be made that way while traveling, at work, exercising at the gym, or participating in sport activities. LeCharm’s tea beverage, on the other hand, can be brought to all those environments. As long as water can be obtained or carried, there’s no limit to the places where you can make fresh batches of tea drinks. The tea powder sachets of our crystallized tea extract is small, so there won’t be any problem finding a place to slip them inside. LeCharm is tea on the go, and it can be three seconds away no matter where you are. The tea is instant at every situation: made in a cup while you’re in your car, made in a bottle when you’re out for a run or at the gym, made in the break room or by a water cooler, made on a plane with a cup of water you’ve asked for, or made at a restaurant instead of paying so much for a sugary drink.
